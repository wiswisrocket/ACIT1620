            <p id="bio">My name is Luis and I am a video editor. I specialize in social media content, event videos and YouTube videos.
                I can help with my experience in text animation, sound design and colour grading.
                <br><br>
                Since early childhood I have always been mesmerized with stories and films.
                I started making videos when I was 11 years old with stop motion LEGO movies and I knew immediately that I loved making movies.
                As an adult, I decided to pursue my love for making videos, telling stories and expanding my skills in it.
                <br><br>
                I have been lucky enough to be able tell so many different people's stories and their achievements and make the occasional funny video through my work
                with Anytime Fitness and I would love to be able to help you with your vision to entertain or tell your stories.</p>
